# LASTDANCE: Layerwise Activation Similarity to Training Data for Assessing Non-Conforming Events

This is the repo for LASTDANCE, a novel method for out-of-distribution detection which leverages feature trajectory through the network, rather than using a single "optimal" layer, or an "early exit" network/ensemble, which sacrifices performance on the task. Using this trajectory paradigm, we set a new state-of-the-art result on Competency Estimation.

TODO
project onto unit ball -> cosine similarity
johnson lindenstrauss bound maybe?
